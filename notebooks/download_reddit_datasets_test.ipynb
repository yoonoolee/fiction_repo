Get locked in the portal-belt for a month or so, take a random dick or two a day, enjoy the occasional generous tongue, but ultimately get paid lazing around the house all day. You didn't expect to be one of the most popular 'Toys' on the app\"}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Portal Panties\\n\\nLacy looked at the app on her phone. All she had to do was hit the button marked \"Accept\" and her first shift would begin. She looked at the profile picture above the button. It was her of course, leaning back on her bed, tits hanging out of a lacy black bra, legs spread wide and fingers spreading her neatly trimmed pussy. She was wearing a black carnival mask but the picture was seriously hot.\\xa0\\n\\nIf she pressed the button the panties would activate and anyone who used the app would be able to connect their portal toy to Lacy\\'s pussy or ass anytime over the next month. The portal system was a simple two way system that connected her crotch to special toys. At most two toys could connect to her at a time and there were a handful of windows when only the portal on the outside of the panties connected to the inside. This allowed her time for hygiene and rest.\\xa0\\n\\nThe money was good, better if Lacy was actively selected by a user. A few of her friends had signed up for the app for a few months. They had told her that they had been selected a few times a day, usually by the \"random\" option. It paid the same but it connected a random user with a new girl. Sometimes this would lead to regulars but most of her friends had only ended up with one or two at best.\\n\\nWith a deep sigh Lacy hit the button. She wasn\\'t worried about being used by random strangers. The portal tech was able to prevent STDs and pregnancy., but it was going to be strange. Shrugging she headed for the kitchen and started her popcorn.\\n\\nAs it popped Lacy used the remote to queue up the movie she had decided to watch. She had wanted to do something low key for her first night \"on duty\" and a movie sounded good. She\\'d found a good rom com starring her favorite Hollywood heartthrob. When the timer went off she grabbed a bowl and poured it in.\\xa0\\n\\nAlmost forty minutes into the movie Lacy heard the chirp of her phone alerting her that she\\'d been selected. She felt a faint hum from the panties and then gasped as she felt a thick cock slide into her pussy. Pausing her movie she stared at the hunky male lead as the cock began to slide in and out of her tight cunt. She felt herself growing even wetter as the fantasy of her movie crush fucking her on her couch played through her mind. Fuck this was hot, her hands drifted beneath her top caressing and squeezing her pert breasts.\\xa0\\n\\nA few minutes later she felt the cock thrust deep into her before spilling a load of cum into her waiting pussy. Another chime sounded a moment later as the cock withdrew. This one asked if she wanted time to clean up. Lacy could take the time now or let the load sit and the app would notify users she was available for sloppy seconds. Frustrated at not finishing after her first client she shrugged. She could clean up later, it wasn\\'t likely she\\'d get another client tonight. Pressing the cancel button she settled back on the couch to watch the rest of the movie.\\n\\nIt wasn’t even five minutes later when the chirp sounded from her phone. Having resigned herself to not getting another client tonight Lacy was surprised when a tongue slid over her cum filled cunt. She moaned, for the first time wondering if whoever was using the portal could hear her. She didn’t care though, this tongue was talented! Sliding over the lips of her cunt it gently parted and probed them experimentally. Lacy could feel the cum starting to ooze from her hole and the tongue ran experimentally through the mess. Determined this time to cum Lacy decided to stimulate herself in the one way the panties still allowed.\\n\\nHands sliding under her top Lacy laid back on the couch to get comfortable. Teasing and squeezing her own breasts felt good combined with the hungry tongue licking and lapping the cum from her freshly used pussy. Her modest breasts felt good under her caressing hands. Gently tugging and teasing her nipples she felt the sensation adding to the sucking, slurping eagerness of the mouth teasing every drop of cum from her creampied cunt. She was getting closer and closer when the tongue stopped. Whimpering with need Lacy squirmed, she didn’t want it to stop yet, she was so close.\\n\\nWhen the mouth returned to work on her plump and swollen cunt it was different. No longer did it seek every nook and crevice of Lacy’s dripping cunt, instead it was more focused and intent. It teased her opening with a practiced and skilled expertise Lacy had never experienced from any of her boyfriends. It suckled and teased her clit expertly. It… Lacy squeezed her own nipples hard as she came. She tried to push against the face licking her pussy but she couldn’t, the portal didn’t give her that kind of leverage. Still she didn’t care as she climaxed. She writhed alone on her couch and flooded the stranger’s mouth with her juices.\\n\\nAs Lacy lay on the couch panting and recovering two chimes sounded from her phone. The first was a notice that her status had been changed from “sloppy” to “cleaned” and the second was a review. Glancing at it she noticed that someone with the user name. Kitty&lt;3Kitten had left her five stars. Blinking Lacy realized she hadn’t felt stubble or facial hair on the last client. Had she just had her first lesbian experience!? Oh, god! She would never even meet this woman but she had made her cum her brains out! Lacy giggled wondering how lucky it was that she had been randomly selected twice.\\n\\nAs she watched the rest of the movie there was another chirp. Lacy knew the drill now and decided to try and watch the movie but when the hard throbbing cock shoved deep into her it was hard to focus. God, it was frustrating not to be able to push back on this guy, his thrusts lacked a good rhythm. Another chime interrupted the thought mid-thrust. She read the alert. Someone with the username BlckM@mb@ was requesting a double penetration. The other user in her pussy must have left the option open. Lacy whimpered, she wasn’t sure about it but… she hit accept. A moment later thick fingers probed her ass, smearing lube on the hole as the second portal opened.\\xa0\\n\\nWhoever BlckM@mb@ was, Lacy was glad he was using plenty of lube, especially as a cock even thicker than the one in her cunt began to gently press into her ass. She took a deep breath and winced slightly as he eased into her asshole, she wasn’t used to this but the price multipliers for double penetration and anal made this a deal too good to pass up. When she finally felt him bottom out she breathed a sigh of relief. She had thought his cock was never going to end. Dimly she realized the man in her cunt had stopped while the newcomer got settled but as if they had some hidden cue the two began again. This time the cock in her ass set the pace, and following his lead the one in her cunt felt much better. Lacy dimly wished she could rub her clit as this was so fucking hot. She settled instead for teasing her tits.\\xa0 She came, holes spasming around the two shafts before they even finished. She was only dimly aware of them filling her with spunk as she smiled dumbly in post orgasmic bliss.\\n\\nThis time when the alert gave her time to clean up Lacy smiled to herself and clicked no again. She briefly wondered if another woman might help clean her up. A few moments later a chime alerted her that a return customer was accessing. When she felt the tongue on her clit she welcomed it. Another chime sounded and Lacy’s eyes widened. Another client was requesting to eat the creampie from her ass! She clicked accept knowing she was going to need a break after this one. When both mouths were finally satisfied and her holes were clean save for their lingering spit Lacy was exhausted, her third climax had driven her wild and her tits were sore from near constant play. Stupidly, Lacy wondered if she would get addicted to tit play after a month or so of this.\\n\\nClicking the app and giving herself time to clean up and rest Lacy heard a few more chimes. She had set the phone aside while she used the bathroom and cleaned up further. She picked up her phone slowly and glanced at the alerts. “You have 3… 4 Users waiting! Please click accept when ready to continue.” Lacy whimpered. Four more guys tonight? Her holes already felt stretched and well pounded, but she had signed the contract and she did need the money. Her friends had never told her about anything like this! Hesitantly she clicked accept.\\n\\nA month later Lacy’s contract was up for renewal. As her fourth and fifth regular of the day pounded her holes she sat in a coffee shop looking over the agreement. It was hard not to react but she had gotten better at it. Now there was hardly a moment of her day when she didn’t have a cock in her cunt or ass, but without a little tit play or a particularly good client she had figured out how to function. Of course when her favorite regular booked her for cleanup she usually had to find a quiet place to cum her brains out but she didn’t mind. She’d made it to the top 1% of the app’s toys and the money was enough she was thinking of doing this full time. This time with no hesitation she clicked accept.'}]\n",

Her parents called her discontent a ‘teenage phase’, but she hated how her family could only express their feelings in food. Her parents had been pushing sweet, rich food on her for months.\\n\\nTired of staring at the ceiling, she wandered over to Grandma’s cabinet filled with VCRs. \\n\\n“Just like them to have a basement full of crap.” Veronica muttered. “Would it kill them to buy a DVD player?”\\n\\nEach tape was meticulously labeled with a name. It took Veronica a second to recognize many of the names – each tape was for a deceased family member. At the top of the pile, there was a tape marked ‘Veronica’. Maybe it was an old aunt?\\n\\nCurious, she popped it into the VCR player. Images popped up immediately, nto of some deceased family member, but of Veronica. She stared at the screen uncomprehendingly.

       "      <td>I remember my first days as a doctor. I wore my stethoscope proudly around my neck, not realizing it advertised how much of a virgin I was in the field of medicine. I'd introduce myself as Dr. Agon and tried to smile more than smirk smugly, usually I couldn't help the smug smirk. Some people noticed my name now read Dragon, not the reason I went into medicine, but still pretty damn cool I thought. \\n\\nI remember my first surgery, the first one I performed, the first one that was all mine. My mask hiding a huge smug smirk as I cut open a live human being before closing her up, everything having gone quite smoothly. It felt easy, it felt right.\\n\\nSaving a life was euphoric. I felt I was more than a man. I was untouchable. \\n\\nI remember the first time i relieved someone of life. It was a kid. He had cancer. I would say lung cancer but it had spread. He was more cancer than human in the end. He had been nuked and cut and he'd eaten every fucking pill there is. He was a husk. A human that had known nothing but suffering. He'd been born and 3 years later he had cancer. 3 years of life before death moved into his body. He asked me if he could sleep more. I knew he was dying. Nothing more we could do for him. But we're supposed to preserve life, never to take it. I did though. Life wasn't anything worth preserving in this kid. The parts of his blood not full of cancer cells, I filled with morphine. I could have killed 3 full grown men with what I gave him, but he was no ordinary kid. After that I felt like shit. I told the parents he'd just died in the night. He was just buried. I was the reason he was dead. I called in sick for four days. Not crying, just not doing anything, taking his life had taken away all my energy. I got over it.\\n\\nMy second killing was easier. A pillow over a head. He was old. 85 I think, give or take 5 years. Didn't really matter. He'd been sick for a while. He was a psychiatric patient. Wasn't going to die anytime soon. He was old and frail, his mind was froth, nothing left worth leaving, but he wasn't about to die anytime soon. His heart and lungs in good health. He'd shout all night, waking up other patients. I was the doctor on call. All the calls were for him. Give him something to sleep. Give him more. Give him more. I knew how we'd both get some sleep. And it felt good and very right. A pillow over his face. I liked how he struggled because I could feel how much power I had over his frail body. I was way bigger than him, more than him, this dying man. After he died I turned him so that he lay on his stomach. Everyone thought he'd just fallen asleep on his stomach, too frail to turn himself around in bed and suffocated. I knew better. As usual I knew more than your average idiot on the street. That smirk worming its way to my lips at the funeral. There wasn't much reason for me to be there, but it felt good to stand in a room full of ignorance. They knew nothing, only me and perhaps god if he exists, but probably only me. Only me.\\n\\nIt started becoming a part of me. I loved saving lives, but I needed to take them. It was my drug, my passion. I was good at it. The coroner never found or suspected a thing. Another idiot. He finished top at John Hopkins, yet was just like the other fucking idiots. \\n\\nI started liking more to take young lives. Take lives that weren't meant to be taken yet. Lives that death hadn't put its mark on yet. I was moving outside the hospital. I would put cyanide into foods in cafeterias of schools. Nobody died but it was fun to be able to spread disease. A nice hobby around my art.</td>\n",

The smallest toe on each foot is bent somewhat from the undersize cleats she refused to throw away last year. Her feet are a pale white, smooth and unmottled, except for a slight indent where her sandals have gotten used to resting. There's a mark on her left ankle from the nick of a careless razor pass. Her legs, smoothly muscled, are just beginning to show the very slightest of stubble. They are long and thin, and covered near the top by a light cotton dress, sky blue, soft and wrinkled, sort of airy, like it isn't really there. The dress has no waste, tapering instead just below her breasts, which are cast in the shadows by a leafless tree between us and the heat of the sun. The collar is a shallow v-shape, and gives an oddly square look to her shoulders, which support smooth white arms and two imperfect little hands, the nails painted with a clear laquer that splits in the middle of her left thumb. Her neck is impossibly slender, it seems, for someone so fiercely stubborn. It supports her head, and her sharp blue-gray eyes, the tiny wrinkles below them, the smallish rounded ears, and hair the color of honey. \\n\\nThe hair. It's everywhere at once, long strands that flow in every direction, thin and curved and straight and shallow and shaking around as I run my fingers through them. Her lips. They're pursed in that happy, slightly-judgmental shape that they always get in when she thinks I'm being silly, but I'm not being silly this time. I'm sad. We're laying in grass that her father has given up taming for the season, the yellowed blades sporting mottled interruptions of hardier weeds, the sharp edges of the dead lawn scraping our backs. The sky is pale and harsh, a blue that could only come from the dead heat of summer, when it's nearly one hundred degrees outside. There are no clouds to happily personify.

There are no doors to any outside world, there are no windows to the sun, there are no locks with which to leave. Nothing, nada, zilch, null. All I can do is think and hear the whispers that come from above me, like schizophrenic angels trying to tell me the secrets of the universe. Sometimes the words are clear; I once heard a female voice telling me, \"Wake up, please.\" Other times, I hear sniffling, that turns to sobbing, and then finally, to the silence that serves as my inconsistent intermission, as the pauses last anywhere from very long drags of time to the shortest of conversational lulls--a pause of breath.\\n\\nSometimes I wish I knew why the words came to me, and why they are so melancholy. Their messages are all so very sad, as if they are praying for someone to return from what must be a very long, distant journey. I like to think of where this person must have gone, and what they were like. Maybe they were some sort of royalty, a king or a queen riding on tall stallions to the green pastures of another kingdom. Or the modern warrior of markets, the lean businessman with the hungry look on his face, happens to be on extended leave in the exotic east Asian countries, as he is very busy bartering over the price of silk and cheap labor.\\n\\nBut as the voices continue, I grow so tired. There is only so much one can take of the mosquito buzzing in his ear. If I had the power, I would slap the voices away from my ear and put the tiny carcasses into the corner, so I would never have to acknowledge them again. But that would kill them, and the thought of violence to beings that care so much about a friend sickens me. So I let them whisper, and I tell myself they don't know that I'm down here, or else they would have found me and apologized for their chatter. I'd tell them it was just fine, and to please take me out of this white room, because as lovely as the white is, I fear that I no longer know what the color black looks like, or if I ever knew at all...</td>\n",

There is no known way to divert the mass with current technology. Scientists admit that it is impossible for us to have any appreciable effect on it's trajectory. For all practical purposes, our planet is doomed...*\\n\\nWhen the news first broke, people were for the most part, unimpressed. 150 years was too far into the future for them to really be concerned by it. Surely something could be done. Besides, it would not affect them. They would be long dead by then.\\n\\nThe next generation was a bit more concerned about the looming disaster. They had far fewer children. They were generally more on edge. Crime rates soared. However, for the most part, life went on as usual. Still, they would live out their lives and the event would not affect them in any meaningful way. Perhaps their children would find a solution.\\n\\nBy the third generation people were born into a world that would cease to exist within their lifetimes. The future suddenly became a priority. \\n\\nThe entire world now focused all their resources, all their scientific effort into coming up with a viable solution. For the first time in human history they became one people. Countries forgot their disagreements, wars were abandoned. Every human breath, every human effort was geared towards a single goal. To save their world.\\n\\nThey had finally become what we already know we can be. As you all know, it was far too late for that to save them.\\n\\nWhat few of us *could* be saved fled the Earth when the asteroid was still well outside the solar system. We are the children of the race of man.\\n\\nThis is why we must remember the people of Earth, my students. They never realized their true potential until it was too late. We must learn from their mistake and not allow our own people to become apathetic. This is why we teach you this lesson. \\n\\nThere was a saying back on earth. \"Those who forget history, are doomed to repeat it.\"\\n\\nWe, the people of the planet *Terra*, will never forget. \\n\\n\\n\\n</td>\n",

As I put my items down on the cashier's belt, Aaron bursts out laughing again.\\n\\n\"What?\" I glance up.\\n\\n\"She put a pack of gum down with her items.\" He whispers back. \"That puts her at ten.\"\\n\\nFor some reason the audacity of this sends us both into howls of laughter.

Well, it's been two weeks since this girl, a girl that has filled my mind to the brim with her essence, said that. I'm about to leave for college, and it burns worse than ever.\\n\\nI remember I was a nervous wreck when I asked her to the homecoming dance junior year. God, I was so scared, but she replied with an enthusiastic *YES* and I knew things were going to be great. The night of the dance was one of the best of my life. That's where I kissed her for the first time. Before I knew it, we were going out to see movies, get coffee, etc. The image of her, curled up by my side, head resting on my chest, was imprinted in my head.\\n\\nThen she started going stiff. She backed away. I wondered why, but she told me that things were getting to complex, that she couldn't handle a boyfriend.\\n\\n *I don't want to talk about it right now.*\\n\\nAnd, just like that, we split. Not only that, but we didn't talk for a year, not until the first day of senior year when I decided to sit next to her in AP Biology. Sure, it was awkward at first, but I started trying to mend old wounds. It worked. She would laugh at my jokes like she used to as I rebuilt our friend ship.\\n\\nBut it started again. I started looking at her a bit differently. The class started becoming more than just the ordinary science class; I looked forward to each lab and lecture because I knew I’d be spending the next hour and a half next to her. She was a jewel. I don't know if it was love (hell, I don't know if I've ever felt love) but it was something. Prom was approaching and, of course, she was my number one candidate. Meanwhile, another friend of mine, another girl, was making attempts to get close to me. I was somewhat torn between my ex who I was slowly becoming re-obsessed with, and a girl who was making it relatively known to like me. I couldn’t decide. So I did the worst possible thing: I waited to think about it. The other girl was later asked by the bass player in one of the school’s garage bands during a show. When I discovered this, I went to my ex, but she had already been taken too.\\n\\nSo, the days following prom, I sat at my computer and cycled through her facebook pictures of her night, Pictures of her smiling, laughing, and dancing in the arms of another guy. I only blamed myself; I had treated her like an option. Still, seeing her like this upset me. The fact that I wasn’t the only person in her life to uplift her world stung me.\\n\\nThings were still good in class though. We still laughed. We still learned. Except I felt defeated. Before I knew it, I was walking across that stage during graduation. Hundreds of my peers cheered, I should have been just as enthused…but I was too busy thinking of *her*. In a few months, I would never see her again. Hell, *this* might be my last time seeing her…\\n\\nFast forward three weeks, I’m at Myrtle for Beach Week and I haven’t talked to her since school. Well, I guess a little bit of vodka decided to change that. We talked a bit; I guess to cut thing short, she was having a pretty boring summer while mine was kinda fun. To my surprise, she told me that she wanted to hang out after I got back.\\n\\nSo I took her to see *Magic Mike*…\\n\\nIt was good, and at the end, for the first time in nearly two years, I kissed her. \\n\\nThings then just sort of continued from there. She would come over to my house, we would go see more movies, and we would eat things….\\n\\nAnd I knew it wouldn’t last, because dating your ex is like rereading a book: It’s fun and has its amazing moments, but you already know how it’s going to end. We were leaving for college, of course we couldn’t make things last. Somewhere…deep in the back of my mind, I knew this, but I ignored it. Maybe it’s because I was in love?\\n\\nThe weekend before leaving for school, we were going to get coffee, but stopped responding to my texts. I sent text after text after text as casually as possible to get something out of her until she responded.\\n\\n*Listen…I don’t know if I can see you before I leave…*\\n\\nI tried calling her, but she didn’t pick up. Instead of giving me the satisfaction of her listening to my voice, and me listening to her’s, she only texted back.\\n\\n*I don't want to talk about it right now.*\\n\\nAnd that was that.\\n\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>He had even torn the label off, just in case. Because a whiskey bottle just doesn't look like a whiskey bottle without the label. Like they sell apple juice in square bottles now or something.\\n\\nAnd he'd hidden it so well. Jeremy had had to take the unlikeliest of actions to stumble across this cache of his father's failure. He had moved the rice on the top shelf of the pantry *slightly to the left*. Only archeologists might have found it otherwise. Moron.\\n\\nHe didn't remember too much from before Henry got sober. Most of those memories either hadn't stuck in an unformed mind, or had gotten blocked out by repeated pubescent escapism. He knew he'd been generally scared, he remembered a lot of crying. Mostly he didn't think about it. \\n\\nMom thought about it. Jeremy saw it in her face. She was flinchy, unsure. Her words were timid and few, or else biting and acidic, accompanied by a red face and snotty tears. Jeremy usually took that venom. The adult tantrum of shaking and screaming. Only in the last six months or so had he started to see the fear behind it.\\n\\nAnd with only another six months to go. Graduation and two days later a legal adult. That bastard. Jeremy felt himself shift suddenly and unpleasantly down, like the part on the roller coaster when it's about to get fun. It didn't get fun. Instead he just kept sinking, finally finding himself on the floor, back against cheap paneling. \\n\\nJeremy sat there for most of his life or a few minutes, slumped. Holding the cheap, plastic bottle like Yorrick's skull. Trying to see into it. Trying to see it's claws. Trying to see the temptress. His fingers were soon tacky from the glue left behind by the label. He just kept turning it and turning it, casting brown rays on the floor. The same thought bubbled up over, and over, and over.\\n\\nWe're not gonna make it. \\n\\nThe cap was tighter than he'd thought, and he wrestled a bit to break the safety seal. The plastic unsnapped and separated suddenly, spilling a bit of the whiskey into his lap. It smelled terrible.\\n\\n</td>\n",

Upstairs, the rest of the family were happily chatting away. Veronica sighed. She hated the insincerity of family events. Her parents called her discontent a ‘teenage phase’, but she hated how her family could only express their feelings in food. Her parents had been pushing sweet, rich food on her for months.\\n\\nTired of staring at the ceiling, she wandered over to Grandma’s cabinet filled with VCRs. \\n\\n“Just like them to have a basement full of crap.” Veronica muttered. “Would it kill them to buy a DVD player?”\\n\\nEach tape was meticulously labeled with a name. It took Veronica a second to recognize many of the names – each tape was for a deceased family member. At the top of the pile, there was a tape marked ‘Veronica’. Maybe it was an old aunt?\\n\\nCurious, she popped it into the VCR player. Images popped up immediately, nto of some deceased family member, but of Veronica. She stared at the screen uncomprehendingly. Baby Veronica toddling across the yard, graduating from school, going to prom… Then a screen: “In honor of our sacrifice on August 8th, 2012.”\\n\\nFrom upstairs, a call: “Veronica, dinner!”   \n",
       "1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         I remember my first days as a doctor. I wore my stethoscope proudly around my neck, not realizing it advertised how much of a virgin I was in the field of medicine. I'd introduce myself as Dr. Agon and tried to smile more than smirk smugly, usually I couldn't help the smug smirk. Some people noticed my name now read Dragon, not the reason I went into medicine, but still pretty damn cool I thought. \\n\\nI remember my first surgery, the first one I performed, the first one that was all mine. My mask hiding a huge smug smirk as I cut open a live human being before closing her up, everything having gone quite smoothly. It felt easy, it felt right.\\n\\nSaving a life was euphoric. I felt I was more than a man. I was untouchable. \\n\\nI remember the first time i relieved someone of life. It was a kid. He had cancer. I would say lung cancer but it had spread. He was more cancer than human in the end. He had been nuked and cut and he'd eaten every fucking pill there is. He was a husk. A human that had known nothing but suffering. He'd been born and 3 years later he had cancer. 3 years of life before death moved into his body. He asked me if he could sleep more. I knew he was dying. Nothing more we could do for him. But we're supposed to preserve life, never to take it. I did though. Life wasn't anything worth preserving in this kid. The parts of his blood not full of cancer cells, I filled with morphine. I could have killed 3 full grown men with what I gave him, but he was no ordinary kid. After that I felt like shit. I told the parents he'd just died in the night. He was just buried. I was the reason he was dead. I called in sick for four days. Not crying, just not doing anything, taking his life had taken away all my energy. I got over it.\\n\\nMy second killing was easier. A pillow over a head. He was old. 85 I think, give or take 5 years. Didn't really matter. He'd been sick for a while. He was a psychiatric patient. Wasn't going to die anytime soon. He was old and frail, his mind was froth, nothing left worth leaving, but he wasn't about to die anytime soon. His heart and lungs in good health. He'd shout all night, waking up other patients. I was the doctor on call. All the calls were for him. Give him something to sleep. Give him more. Give him more. I knew how we'd both get some sleep. And it felt good and very right. A pillow over his face. I liked how he struggled because I could feel how much power I had over his frail body. I was way bigger than him, more than him, this dying man. After he died I turned him so that he lay on his stomach. Everyone thought he'd just fallen asleep on his stomach, too frail to turn himself around in bed and suffocated. I knew better. As usual I knew more than your average idiot on the street. That smirk worming its way to my lips at the funeral. There wasn't much reason for me to be there, but it felt good to stand in a room full of ignorance. They knew nothing, only me and perhaps god if he exists, but probably only me. Only me.\\n\\nIt started becoming a part of me. I loved saving lives, but I needed to take them. It was my drug, my passion. I was good at it. The coroner never found or suspected a thing. Another idiot. He finished top at John Hopkins, yet was just like the other fucking idiots. \\n\\nI started liking more to take young lives. Take lives that weren't meant to be taken yet. Lives that death hadn't put its mark on yet. I was moving outside the hospital. I would put cyanide into foods in cafeterias of schools. Nobody died but it was fun to be able to spread disease. A nice hobby around my art.    \n",

They're painted a vivid dark blue, striking no matter the backdrop, even though the finish is fading. The smallest toe on each foot is bent somewhat from the undersize cleats she refused to throw away last year. Her feet are a pale white, smooth and unmottled, except for a slight indent where her sandals have gotten used to resting. There's a mark on her left ankle from the nick of a careless razor pass. Her legs, smoothly muscled, are just beginning to show the very slightest of stubble. They are long and thin, and covered near the top by a light cotton dress, sky blue, soft and wrinkled, sort of airy, like it isn't really there. The dress has no waste, tapering instead just below her breasts, which are cast in the shadows by a leafless tree between us and the heat of the sun. The collar is a shallow v-shape, and gives an oddly square look to her shoulders, which support smooth white arms and two imperfect little hands, the nails painted with a clear laquer that splits in the middle of her left thumb. Her neck is impossibly slender, it seems, for someone so fiercely stubborn. It supports her head, and her sharp blue-gray eyes, the tiny wrinkles below them, the smallish rounded ears, and hair the color of honey. \\n\\nThe hair. It's everywhere at once, long strands that flow in every direction, thin and curved and straight and shallow and shaking around as I run my fingers through them. Her lips. They're pursed in that happy, slightly-judgmental shape that they always get in when she thinks I'm being silly, but I'm not being silly this time. I'm sad. We're laying in grass that her father has given up taming for the season, the yellowed blades sporting mottled interruptions of hardier weeds, the sharp edges of the dead lawn scraping our backs. The sky is pale and harsh, a blue that could only come from the dead heat of summer, when it's nearly one hundred degrees outside. There are no clouds to happily personify. She's leaving back to college tomorrow.\\n   \n",

The second thing you need is food. Beyond that, you start dealing in wants, not needs. I wanted to be alone, though, solitary, and I got that. This is isn't a boy scout camp, this isn't Remember the Titans, comradery won't win this championship, other people are a liability.\\n\\nWhen it hit we stayed organized long enough for widespread evacuations. 'We' refers to we the general, we the human civilization. Past tense.\\n\\nI stayed. I found a small, completely abandoned apartment complex, and made it secure. Before they turned the water off, I filled every bathtub with water. There's food to scavenge in the various apartments. My needs were filled for the first two weeks, I calculate for the next two weeks as well. Everything else is a want. And I have a great view. Some nights, alone, I look out the window and see them milling aimlessly, their clouded eyes reflecting the moon, a glint lacking intelligence. And sometimes I can hear them moaning. And I realize that I am moaning also, inside my solitary fortress. We are moaning. we the human civilization. Past tense.   \n",

You have ensnared me in your brilliance, your lack of shade or hue, your eternal light.\\n\\nBut there is so little to do in this white room. There are no doors to any outside world, there are no windows to the sun, there are no locks with which to leave. Nothing, nada, zilch, null. All I can do is think and hear the whispers that come from above me, like schizophrenic angels trying to tell me the secrets of the universe. Sometimes the words are clear; I once heard a female voice telling me, \"Wake up, please.\" Other times, I hear sniffling, that turns to sobbing, and then finally, to the silence that serves as my inconsistent intermission, as the pauses last anywhere from very long drags of time to the shortest of conversational lulls--a pause of breath.\\n\\nSometimes I wish I knew why the words came to me, and why they are so melancholy. Their messages are all so very sad, as if they are praying for someone to return from what must be a very long, distant journey. I like to think of where this person must have gone, and what they were like. Maybe they were some sort of royalty, a king or a queen riding on tall stallions to the green pastures of another kingdom. Or the modern warrior of markets, the lean businessman with the hungry look on his face, happens to be on extended leave in the exotic east Asian countries, as he is very busy bartering over the price of silk and cheap labor.\\n\\nBut as the voices continue, I grow so tired. There is only so much one can take of the mosquito buzzing in his ear. If I had the power, I would slap the voices away from my ear and put the tiny carcasses into the corner, so I would never have to acknowledge them again. But that would kill them, and the thought of violence to beings that care so much about a friend sickens me. So I let them whisper, and I tell myself they don't know that I'm down here, or else they would have found me and apologized for their chatter. I'd tell them it was just fine, and to please take me out of this white room, because as lovely as the white is, I fear that I no longer know what the color black looks like, or if I ever knew at all...   \n",

There weas a light layer of water hfrom the hotube they were in on his sezy chest. they were a hottbu in Newt's foyer. thee water coming out from the jets was soothing, moving at terminal velocity. \\n\\n\"Gladt o see your up Newt.\" said Santorum, lustily. \\n\\n\"I cant tell you how much I want you rivk.\" said Gringich.\\n\\n\"But I already ordered pixza\", said Rick , hungril.\\n\\n\"But rick, /pizza cannot astusdy my urges for you.\" \\n\\n\"But our politica view-\"\\n\\n\"Let's not think about that now, Rick.\" \\n\\nNewt gentle removed Santurms shirt which he ut on since the last tome I descrived him.

There is no known way to divert the mass with current technology. Scientists admit that it is impossible for us to have any appreciable effect on it's trajectory. For all practical purposes, our planet is doomed...*\\n\\nWhen the news first broke, people were for the most part, unimpressed. 150 years was too far into the future for them to really be concerned by it. Surely something could be done. Besides, it would not affect them. They would be long dead by then.\\n\\nThe next generation was a bit more concerned about the looming disaster. They had far fewer children. They were generally more on edge. Crime rates soared. However, for the most part, life went on as usual. Still, they would live out their lives and the event would not affect them in any meaningful way. Perhaps their children would find a solution.\\n\\nBy the third generation people were born into a world that would cease to exist within their lifetimes. The future suddenly became a priority. \\n\\nThe entire world now focused all their resources, all their scientific effort into coming up with a viable solution. For the first time in human history they became one people. Countries forgot their disagreements, wars were abandoned. Every human breath, every human effort was geared towards a single goal. To save their world.\\n\\nThey had finally become what we already know we can be. As you all know, it was far too late for that to save them.\\n\\nWhat few of us *could* be saved fled the Earth when the asteroid was still well outside the solar system. We are the children of the race of man.\\n\\nThis is why we must remember the people of Earth, my students. They never realized their true potential until it was too late. We must learn from their mistake and not allow our own people to become apathetic. This is why we teach you this lesson. \\n\\nThere was a saying back on earth. \"Those who forget history, are doomed to repeat it.\"\\n\\nWe, the people of the planet *Terra*, will never forget. \\n\\n\\n\\n   \n",

Two. Three. Four. Five. Six. Seven. Eight. \\n\\nNine.\\n\\nI lean over to Aaron and hiss in a low voice: \"She's over the limit.\"\\n\\nHe glances over and scans the items on the conveyor belt and then bursts into laughter. He points at the sign, which clearly reads \"EXPRESS LANE 1-8 ITEMS.\"\\n\\n\"Barely.\" He chortles. \\n\\n\"It doesn't matter!\" I insist. \"Look, there are *rules* to a society, you can't just break them willy nilly.\"\\n\\nThe lady in front of us, the rule-breaker, turns her head slightly and we both quiet down; both of us are snickering like children. The cashier begins to scan her items. One, two, three... I can see her lips moving all the way up to nine. She glances up at the woman. This outlaw doesn't look like a lady who will budge, even though the policy is clear as day. Her hair is tightly wound, her lips are compressed together, and her fingers dance on the edge of her wallet in impatience. The cashier casts her eyes back down, avoiding the fight to live another day. \\n\\nI imagine a world where the rules are strictly enforced, and where this lady would be cast out to the long lines of the regular cashouts where she belongs. As I put my items down on the cashier's belt, Aaron bursts out laughing again.\\n\\n\"What?\" I glance up.\\n\\n\"She put a pack of gum down with her items.\" He whispers back. \"That puts her at ten.\"\\n\\nFor some reason the audacity of this sends us both into howls of laughter. The ten-item bandit picks up her plastic bag with a huff and stalks away, clearly unimpressed by our display of jolliness.\\n\\nWell, at least I follow the rules.   \n",
       "8  *I don't want to talk about it right now.*\\n\\nFor some reason, I thought that phrase wouldn't sting nearly as bad the second time. Well, it's been two weeks since this girl, a girl that has filled my mind to the brim with her essence, said that. I'm about to leave for college, and it burns worse than ever.\\n\\nI remember I was a nervous wreck when I asked her to the homecoming dance junior year. God, I was so scared, but she replied with an enthusiastic *YES* and I knew things were going to be great. The night of the dance was one of the best of my life. That's where I kissed her for the first time. Before I knew it, we were going out to see movies, get coffee, etc. The image of her, curled up by my side, head resting on my chest, was imprinted in my head.\\n\\nThen she started going stiff. She backed away. I wondered why, but she told me that things were getting to complex, that she couldn't handle a boyfriend.\\n\\n *I don't want to talk about it right now.*\\n\\nAnd, just like that, we split. Not only that, but we didn't talk for a year, not until the first day of senior year when I decided to sit next to her in AP Biology. Sure, it was awkward at first, but I started trying to mend old wounds. It worked. She would laugh at my jokes like she used to as I rebuilt our friend ship.\\n\\nBut it started again. I started looking at her a bit differently. The class started becoming more than just the ordinary science class; I looked forward to each lab and lecture because I knew I’d be spending the next hour and a half next to her. She was a jewel. I don't know if it was love (hell, I don't know if I've ever felt love) but it was something. Prom was approaching and, of course, she was my number one candidate. Meanwhile, another friend of mine, another girl, was making attempts to get close to me. I was somewhat torn between my ex who I was slowly becoming re-obsessed with, and a girl who was making it relatively known to like me. I couldn’t decide. So I did the worst possible thing: I waited to think about it. The other girl was later asked by the bass player in one of the school’s garage bands during a show. When I discovered this, I went to my ex, but she had already been taken too.\\n\\nSo, the days following prom, I sat at my computer and cycled through her facebook pictures of her night, Pictures of her smiling, laughing, and dancing in the arms of another guy. I only blamed myself; I had treated her like an option. Still, seeing her like this upset me. The fact that I wasn’t the only person in her life to uplift her world stung me.\\n\\nThings were still good in class though. We still laughed. We still learned. Except I felt defeated. Before I knew it, I was walking across that stage during graduation. Hundreds of my peers cheered, I should have been just as enthused…but I was too busy thinking of *her*. In a few months, I would never see her again. Hell, *this* might be my last time seeing her…\\n\\nFast forward three weeks, I’m at Myrtle for Beach Week and I haven’t talked to her since school. Well, I guess a little bit of vodka decided to change that. We talked a bit; I guess to cut thing short, she was having a pretty boring summer while mine was kinda fun. To my surprise, she told me that she wanted to hang out after I got back.\\n\\nSo I took her to see *Magic Mike*…\\n\\nIt was good, and at the end, for the first time in nearly two years, I kissed her. \\n\\nThings then just sort of continued from there. She would come over to my house, we would go see more movies, and we would eat things….\\n\\nAnd I knew it wouldn’t last, because dating your ex is like rereading a book: It’s fun and has its amazing moments, but you already know how it’s going to end. We were leaving for college, of course we couldn’t make things last. Somewhere…deep in the back of my mind, I knew this, but I ignored it. Maybe it’s because I was in love?\\n\\nThe weekend before leaving for school, we were going to get coffee, but stopped responding to my texts. I sent text after text after text as casually as possible to get something out of her until she responded.\\n\\n*Listen…I don’t know if I can see you before I leave…*\\n\\nI tried calling her, but she didn’t pick up. Instead of giving me the satisfaction of her listening to my voice, and me listening to her’s, she only texted back.\\n\\n*I don't want to talk about it right now.*\\n\\nAnd that was that.\\n\\n   \n",

Because a whiskey bottle just doesn't look like a whiskey bottle without the label. Like they sell apple juice in square bottles now or something.\\n\\nAnd he'd hidden it so well. Jeremy had had to take the unlikeliest of actions to stumble across this cache of his father's failure. He had moved the rice on the top shelf of the pantry *slightly to the left*. Only archeologists might have found it otherwise. Moron.\\n\\nHe didn't remember too much from before Henry got sober. Most of those memories either hadn't stuck in an unformed mind, or had gotten blocked out by repeated pubescent escapism. He knew he'd been generally scared, he remembered a lot of crying. Mostly he didn't think about it. \\n\\nMom thought about it. Jeremy saw it in her face. She was flinchy, unsure. Her words were timid and few, or else biting and acidic, accompanied by a red face and snotty tears. Jeremy usually took that venom. The adult tantrum of shaking and screaming. Only in the last six months or so had he started to see the fear behind it.\\n\\nAnd with only another six months to go. Graduation and two days later a legal adult. That bastard. Jeremy felt himself shift suddenly and unpleasantly down, like the part on the roller coaster when it's about to get fun. It didn't get fun. Instead he just kept sinking, finally finding himself on the floor, back against cheap paneling. \\n\\nJeremy sat there for most of his life or a few minutes, slumped. Holding the cheap, plastic bottle like Yorrick's skull. Trying to see into it. Trying to see it's claws. Trying to see the temptress. His fingers were soon tacky from the glue left behind by the label. He just kept turning it and turning it, casting brown rays on the floor. The same thought bubbled up over, and over, and over.\\n\\nWe're not gonna make it. \\n\\nThe cap was tighter than he'd thought, and he wrestled a bit to break the safety seal. The plastic unsnapped and separated suddenly, spilling a bit of the whiskey into his lap. It smelled terrible.\\n\\n   \n",
